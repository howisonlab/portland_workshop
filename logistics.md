## Travel

Participants will book their own travel to Portland (and on to the hotel); keep all receipts for [reimbursement through UT Austin](#reimbursements). Transfers from PDX to the hotel can be as you like, but Portland does have a convenient light rail from the airport ([Google Map link](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Portland+International+Airport,+7000+Northeast+Airport+Way,+Portland,+OR+97218/The+Nines,+a+Luxury+Collection+Hotel,+Portland,+525+Southwest+Morrison+Street,+Portland,+OR+97204/@45.532895,-122.609791,13z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x5495a0aa74dc20d1:0x5bda7693380e5c3d!2m2!1d-122.5950942!2d45.5897694!1m5!1m1!1s0x54950a05a9df9055:0x309cbd634dc61cc0!2m2!1d-122.677912!2d45.5192664!3e3?hl=en-US)).

The meeting itself on April 20th will be held at the [OSHU Collaborative Life Sciences Building](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/vision/collaborative-science-building.cfm) (thanks to OSHU). We will walk from the hotel, along the river, to the meeting venue (or take taxis together if it is raining). See map for walking route ([link to Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/SW+5th+Ave+%26+SW+Morrison+St,+Portland,+OR+97204/Collaborative+Life+Sciences+Bldg+%26+Skourtes+Tower,+2730+SW+Moody+Ave,+Portland,+OR+97201/@45.510887,-122.674772,14z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x54950a05a637651f:0xc5869366258ad447!2m2!1d-122.6775017!2d45.5187982!1m5!1m1!1s0x54950a6bff12e6e5:0x7ecf2e1324ac1fe7!2m2!1d-122.6718697!2d45.5031961!3e2?hl=en-US))



## Meals

We will host dinners for participants on the evening of April 19 and after the workshop on April 20. Locations to be decided.

We will have _only very light refreshments (think fruit and coffee/tea)_ in the meeting room. We have planned funding for reimbursements for breakfast, either at the hotel (please charge to your room) or outside (please keep a receipt). Breakfasts are a good opportunity for additional meetings with other participants.

Lunch on April 20 will also be via reimbursement; there is a food court near the meeting room, we will head down together.

## Reimbursements

Reimbursements will be through UT Austin. Look out for emails from Patricia Reichenbach inviting people to set up in the UT Austin system. Please retain all receipts.
