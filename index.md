We are inviting participants from four research projects, each conducting empirical studies of scientific work on software and data. 

The four groups are Jim Herbsleb’s group at CMU, Christine Borgman’s group based at UCLA, James Howison’s group at UT Austin, and the Data Science Studies Working Group at NYU, Berkeley, and Washington. See [Participants](participants.html) for a full list.

The purpose of the workshop is to better understand each other’s research and current projects, seek points of commonality or productive articulation, and to consider opportunities for future projects, publications, and dissemination of results.

James Howison at UT Austin is organizing the workshop.  Pre-workshop discussions are occurring [via this mailing list](https://utlists.utexas.edu/sympa/info/portland-workshop).
